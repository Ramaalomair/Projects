❄️ Smart Frost – Smart Fridge Mobile App (UI Design in Figma)
Smart Frost is a mobile app UI design for a smart fridge system, created using Figma as part of a user experience course in university . 
The app is designed to help users manage their fridge remotely, stay informed about their food inventory, and reduce waste through smarter tracking 
and recommendations.

📱 Project Overview
Smart Frost transforms the way users interact with their refrigerators by providing a clean, user-friendly interface that connects to a smart fridge.
The design focuses on convenience, nutrition awareness, and food management, all accessible from a mobile device.

🎥 Video Demo
We’ve also created a short video demo to showcase the app in action — how it looks, how users interact with it, and the overall user experience.
This makes it easier to understand the flow and purpose of the app.
