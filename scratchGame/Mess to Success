ðŸ§¼ Mess to Success â€“ A Drag-and-Drop Scratch Game
Mess to Success is an interactive drag-and-drop game created in Scratch as part of my Information Fundamentals course at university. The game is designed for young children to help them learn the step-by-step process of making a sandwich and cleaning up afterward â€” all while having fun!

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Game
The main goal of Mess to Success is to teach children:

Logical sequencing: what steps come first, next, and last.

Task completion: from building the sandwich to tidying up.

Responsibility and routine: cleaning up is just as important as creating.

This mirrors how programming works â€” teaching kids the order of actions, cause and effect, and problem-solving using simple drag-and-drop interactions.

ðŸ§© How to Play
Drag sandwich ingredients to the correct positions in the right order.

Once the sandwich is made, drag tools and trash to clean the workspace.

Receive feedback and enjoy a sense of accomplishment from completing the full task!

ðŸ‘¶ Ideal for:
Young children (ages 4â€“8)

Beginners learning sequencing, logic, and basic interaction with digital interfaces

ðŸ§  What I Learned
While developing this project, I practiced:

Visual programming using Scratch blocks

Designing for a young audience

Implementing drag-and-drop mechanics

Applying logic and flow control in an educational context
